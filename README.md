# digiQuack
digiQuack is an easy DuckyScript to DigiSpark payload converter based on C++. It contains various features including full DuckyScript language support, execution limiter, DigiSpark memory optimizations and more. Note though that currently support of foreign keyboard layouts (not english ones) is rather spotty, so try it out and see if it works out for yourself. The code is well documented with comments so feel free to take a look for yourself.


## Instructions - Online (Recommended) 🌐
You can use digiQuack by visiting the [converter website](https://OCEANOFANYTHINGOFFICIAL.github.io/Ducky2Digi/).

## Instructions - Local 💻
Just download one of the releases or download the source (Ducky2Digi.cpp) and compile it yourself.

>Linux/Mac OS users: use ./Ducky2Digi in the terminal to run and follow the prompt.

>Windows users: Run the Ducky2Digi.exe. Drag and drop the txt file with the payload you want to convert and follow the prompt.

The converted file will be placed in the scripts' directory (or for macOS under the user directory) and will be named DigiSpark Payload.txt. You can then follow seytonic's tutorial (in the credits) to install it on your digispark.
